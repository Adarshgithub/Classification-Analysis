# Classification
1)In **Diabetic patient classification predicted whether patient had diabetes or not** through _**Logistic Regression**_ and _**RandomForest Classifier**_ through performance matrix we evaluated that RandomForest predicted better than Logistic Regression and used Random Forest for prediction.

2)In **Penguin Classsification predicted which species penguins belonged** it is **multi-class classification** did preprocessing of data through standardscalar used Logistic Regression and support vector Machine **evaluated model through Precision,Recall,Confusion Matrix** and other technique and **used Support Vector Machine** as it performed better.

3)In **Fake News detection** imported data from amazon cloud did feature extraction and through **Naive bayes found out which is real news and which one is fake news** and the accuracy of the model was 0.89
